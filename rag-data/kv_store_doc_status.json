    "content": "Axel the Surprisingly Smart Pupil\n\nAxel was the kind of student who always looked like he was daydreaming. While everyone else scribbled notes and highlighted textbooks, Axel stared out the window, doodled on his desk, or just leaned back in his chair like he had all the time in the world.\n\nHe wasnâ€™t exactly lazyâ€”just... chill. He didnâ€™t stress over homework, never pulled all-nighters, and definitely didnâ€™t panic during tests. His friends, on the other hand, were always buried in books.\n\n'Axel, how do you even pass?' his friend Mia asked one day, slamming her history book shut. 'You barely study!'\n\nAxel shrugged, smiling. 'I guess I just pay attention when it counts.'\n\nNo one believed himâ€”until the test results came back.\n\nMia got a B+. Josh got a C. And Axel? An A. Again.\n\n'How??' Josh groaned. 'You were drawing superheroes the whole lesson!'\n\nAxel grinned. 'Yeah, but did you hear what Mr. Hargrove said about Napoleon? It was actually kinda cool.'\n\nIt turned out that Axel had a knack for remembering things the first time he heard them. While others needed flashcards and hours of review, Axel soaked up facts like a sponge without even trying. He didnâ€™t brag about itâ€”he just liked learning in his own way.\n\nEventually, his friends stopped being annoyed and started asking for his tips. Axel helped them see that thereâ€™s more than one way to be smartâ€”and sometimes, the best learning happens when youâ€™re just genuinely curious.\n\nAnd from then on, they all agreed on one thing: never underestimate the chill kid in the back row.",

    "content": "Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni[a] (6 March 1475 â€“ 18 February 1564), known mononymously as Michelangelo,[b][1] was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect,[2] and poet of the High Renaissance. Born in the Republic of Florence, his work was inspired by models from classical antiquity and had a lasting influence on Western art. Michelangelo's creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic arenas define him as an archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci.[3] Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences, Michelangelo is one of the best-documented artists of the 16th century. He was lauded by contemporary biographers as the most accomplished artist of his era.[4][5]\n\nMichelangelo achieved fame early. Two of his best-known works, the PietÃ  and David, were sculpted before the age of 30. Although he did not consider himself a painter, Michelangelo created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of the Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture.[6] At the age of 71, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica. Michelangelo transformed the plan so that the Western end was finished to his design, as was the dome, with some modification, after his death.\n\nMichelangelo was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive.[3] Three biographies were published during his lifetime. One of them, by Giorgio Vasari, proposed that Michelangelo's work transcended that of any artist living or dead, and was \"supreme in not one art alone but in all three\".[7]\n\nIn his lifetime, Michelangelo was often called Il Divino (\"the divine one\").[8] His contemporaries admired his terribilitÃ â€”his ability to instill a sense of awe in viewers of his art. Attempts by subsequent artists to imitate[9] the expressive physicality of Michelangelo's style contributed to the rise of Mannerism, a short-lived movement in Western art between the High Renaissance and the Baroque",

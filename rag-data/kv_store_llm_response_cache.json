His friends, on the other hand, were always buried in books.\n\n'Axel, how do you even pass?' his friend Mia asked one day, slamming her history book shut. 'You barely study!'\n\nAxel shrugged, smiling. 'I guess I just pay attention when it counts.'\n\nNo one believed himâ€”until the test results came back.\n\nMia got a B+. Josh got a C. And Axel? An A. Again.\n\n'How??' Josh groaned. 'You were drawing superheroes the whole lesson!'\n\nAxel grinned. 'Yeah, but did you hear what Mr. Hargrove said about Napoleon? It was actually kinda cool.'\n\nIt turned out that Axel had a knack for remembering things the first time he heard them. While others needed flashcards and hours of review, Axel soaked up facts like a sponge without even trying. He didnâ€™t brag about itâ€”he just liked learning in his own way.\n\nEventually, his friends stopped being annoyed and started asking for his tips. Axel helped them see that thereâ€™s more than one way to be smartâ€”and sometimes, the best learning happens when youâ€™re just genuinely curious.\n\nAnd from then on, they all agreed on one thing: never underestimate the chill kid in the back row.\n######################\nOutput:"

While everyone else scribbled notes and highlighted textbooks, Axel stared out the window, doodled on his desk, or just leaned back in his chair like he had all the time in the world.\\n\\nHe wasnâ€™t exactly lazyâ€”just... chill. He didnâ€™t stress over homework, never pulled all-nighters, and definitely didnâ€™t panic during tests. His friends, on the other hand, were always buried in books.\\n\\n'Axel, how do you even pass?' his friend Mia asked one day, slamming her history book shut. 'You barely study!'\\n\\nAxel shrugged, smiling. 'I guess I just pay attention when it counts.'\\n\\nNo one believed himâ€”until the test results came back.\\n\\nMia got a B+. Josh got a C. And Axel? An A. Again.\\n\\n'How??' Josh groaned. 'You were drawing superheroes the whole lesson!'\\n\\nAxel grinned. 'Yeah, but did you hear what Mr. Hargrove said about Napoleon? It was actually kinda cool.'\\n\\nIt turned out that Axel had a knack for remembering things the first time he heard them. While others needed flashcards and hours of review, Axel soaked up facts like a sponge without even trying. He didnâ€™t brag about itâ€”he just liked learning in his own way.\\n\\nEventually, his friends stopped being annoyed and started asking for his tips. Axel helped them see that thereâ€™s more than one way to be smartâ€”and sometimes, the best learning happens when youâ€™re just genuinely curious.\\n\\nAnd from then on, they all agreed on one thing: never underestimate the chill kid in the back row.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Axel\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Axel is a student who has a unique approach to learning, staying calm and focused, and has a natural ability to retain information.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mia\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Mia is a friend of Axel's who is initially puzzled by his studying habits but later seeks his advice on how to improve her learning.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Josh\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Josh is a friend of Axel's and Mia's, who gets a C on a test and is amazed by Axel's ability to get an A without extensive studying.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mr. Hargrove\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Mr. Hargrove is the teacher who teaches the class that Axel, Mia, and Josh are in, and mentions interesting facts about Napoleon that Axel finds cool.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"The Classroom\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The classroom is the physical location where Axel, Mia, Josh, and Mr. Hargrove interact and learn.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"The Test\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"The test is an evaluation of the students' knowledge, which Axel passes with an A, surprising his friends.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Education\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Education is the broader topic that encompasses the learning process, studying habits, and academic performance of the students.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Axel\\\"<|>\\\"Mia\\\"<|>\\\"Axel and Mia have a friendly relationship, with Mia initially questioning Axel's studying habits, but later seeking his advice.\\\"<|>\\\"friendship, learning from each other\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Axel\\\"<|>\\\"Josh\\\"<|>\\\"Axel and Josh are friends, with Josh being amazed by Axel's academic performance and seeking to understand his approach.\\\"<|>\\\"friendship, mutual respect\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Axel\\\"<|>\\\"Mr. Hargrove\\\"<|>\\\"Axel and Mr. Hargrove have a teacher-student relationship, with Axel finding Mr. Hargrove's teaching interesting and engaging.\\\"<|>\\\"teacher-student, knowledge sharing\\\"<|>6)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Mia\\\"<|>\\\"The Test\\\"<|>\\\"Mia takes the test and gets a B+, which is a decent but not exceptional performance, leading her to seek Axel's advice.\\\"<|>\\\"academic performance, self-improvement\\\"<|>5)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Axel\\\"<|>\\\"Education\\\"<|>\\\"Axel has a unique approach to education, focusing on genuine curiosity and interest, rather than traditional studying methods.\\\"<|>\\\"learning style, academic success\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"learning styles, academic performance, friendship, self-improvement, education\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\nText:\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) models to retrieve and incorporate new information.[1] It modifies interactions with a large language model (LLM) so that the model responds to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, using this information to supplement information from its pre-existing training data.[2] This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information.[2][3] Use cases include providing chatbot access to internal company data or generating responses based on authoritative sources.\n\nRAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses.[4] Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources.[1] According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations,[4][5] which have led to real-world issues like chatbots inventing policies or lawyers citing nonexistent legal cases.[6]\n######################\nOutput:"

Born in the Republic of Florence, his work was inspired by models from classical antiquity and had a lasting influence on Western art. Michelangelo's creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic arenas define him as an archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci.[3] Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences, Michelangelo is one of the best-documented artists of the 16th century. He was lauded by contemporary biographers as the most accomplished artist of his era.[4][5]\n\nMichelangelo achieved fame early. Two of his best-known works, the PietÃ  and David, were sculpted before the age of 30. Although he did not consider himself a painter, Michelangelo created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of the Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture.[6] At the age of 71, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica. Michelangelo transformed the plan so that the Western end was finished to his design, as was the dome, with some modification, after his death.\n\nMichelangelo was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive.[3] Three biographies were published during his lifetime. One of them, by Giorgio Vasari, proposed that Michelangelo's work transcended that of any artist living or dead, and was \"supreme in not one art alone but in all three\".[7]\n\nIn his lifetime, Michelangelo was often called Il Divino (\"the divine one\").[8] His contemporaries admired his terribilitÃ â€”his ability to instill a sense of awe in viewers of his art. Attempts by subsequent artists to imitate[9] the expressive physicality of Michelangelo's style contributed to the rise of Mannerism, a short-lived movement in Western art between the High Renaissance and the Baroque\n######################\nOutput:"

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nMichelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni[a] (6 March 1475 â€“ 18 February 1564), known mononymously as Michelangelo,[b][1] was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect,[2] and poet of the High Renaissance. Born in the Republic of Florence, his work was inspired by models from classical antiquity and had a lasting influence on Western art. Michelangelo's creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic arenas define him as an archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci.[3] Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences, Michelangelo is one of the best-documented artists of the 16th century. He was lauded by contemporary biographers as the most accomplished artist of his era.[4][5]\\n\\nMichelangelo achieved fame early. Two of his best-known works, the PietÃ  and David, were sculpted before the age of 30. Although he did not consider himself a painter, Michelangelo created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of the Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture.[6] At the age of 71, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica. Michelangelo transformed the plan so that the Western end was finished to his design, as was the dome, with some modification, after his death.\\n\\nMichelangelo was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive.[3] Three biographies were published during his lifetime. One of them, by Giorgio Vasari, proposed that Michelangelo's work transcended that of any artist living or dead, and was \\\"supreme in not one art alone but in all three\\\".[7]\\n\\nIn his lifetime, Michelangelo was often called Il Divino (\\\"the divine one\\\").[8] His contemporaries admired his terribilitÃ â€”his ability to instill a sense of awe in viewers of his art. Attempts by subsequent artists to imitate[9] the expressive physicality of Michelangelo's style contributed to the rise of Mannerism, a short-lived movement in Western art between the High Renaissance and the Baroque\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Michelangelo\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Michelangelo was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance, known for his creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic arenas.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Republic of Florence\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The Republic of Florence was the birthplace of Michelangelo and a significant location in his life and work.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Rome\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Rome was the location of the Sistine Chapel, where Michelangelo created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Sistine Chapel\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Sistine Chapel is a prominent location in Rome where Michelangelo worked on several projects, including the ceiling and altar wall.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Laurentian Library\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"The Laurentian Library was designed by Michelangelo, pioneering Mannerist architecture.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"St. Peter's Basilica\\\"<|>\\\"organization\\\"<|>\\\"St. Peter's Basilica was a significant project for Michelangelo, who succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect and transformed the plan.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"High Renaissance\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The High Renaissance was a cultural and artistic movement that influenced Michelangelo's work and style.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Mannerism\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Mannerism was a short-lived movement in Western art that emerged after the High Renaissance, influenced by Michelangelo's style.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Leonardo da Vinci\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Leonardo da Vinci was a rival and elder contemporary of Michelangelo, also considered an archetypal Renaissance man.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Giorgio Vasari\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Giorgio Vasari was a biographer who wrote about Michelangelo's life and work, proposing that his work transcended that of any artist living or dead.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Antonio da Sangallo the Younger\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Antonio da Sangallo the Younger was an architect who preceded Michelangelo as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Michelangelo\\\"<|>\\\"Republic of Florence\\\"<|>\\\"Michelangelo was born in the Republic of Florence, which inspired his work and had a lasting influence on Western art.\\\"<|>\\\"birthplace, artistic inspiration\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Michelangelo\\\"<|>\\\"Rome\\\"<|>\\\"Michelangelo worked on several projects in Rome, including the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's Basilica, leaving a lasting impact on the city's art and architecture.\\\"<|>\\\"work location, artistic contribution\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Michelangelo\\\"<|>\\\"Leonardo da Vinci\\\"<|>\\\"Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci were rivals and contemporaries, both considered archetypal Renaissance men, with a lasting influence on Western art.\\\"<|>\\\"rivalry, artistic influence\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Michelangelo\\\"<|>\\\"Giorgio Vasari\\\"<|>\\\"Giorgio Vasari wrote a biography of Michelangelo, proposing that his work transcended that of any artist living or dead, and was 'supreme in not one art alone but in all three'. \\\"<|>\\\"biographical influence, artistic assessment\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Michelangelo\\\"<|>\\\"Sistine Chapel\\\"<|>\\\"Michelangelo worked on several projects in the Sistine Chapel, including the ceiling and altar wall, creating two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art.\\\"<|>\\\"artistic contribution, cultural significance\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Michelangelo\\\"<|>\\\"High Renaissance\\\"<|>\\\"Michelangelo's work was influenced by the High Renaissance, and he is considered one of the most prominent artists of the movement, with a lasting impact on Western art.\\\"<|>\\\"artistic movement, cultural influence\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"Renaissance art, Italian culture, artistic movements, biographical influence, cultural significance\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1.
